    # --- Notes on Implementing Different Architectures ---
    # To implement CNN or RNN trees:
    # - The build_neural_tree function would need logic to create these network types.
    # - Input data loading and preprocessing would need to handle the specific
    #   dimensions and formats for images (CNN) or sequences (RNN).
    # - Feature selection for CNNs might involve selecting subsets of channels or spatial patches.
    # - Feature selection for RNNs might involve selecting subsets of features at each time step or subsequences.
    # - The input_shape passed to build_neural_tree would need to match the expected
    #   input dimensions of the chosen architecture (e.g., (height, width, channels) for CNN).

    # --- Notes on Hybrid Trees ---
    # Implementing the hybrid splitting criteria (Section II.B) would require
    # a significantly different structure for the build_neural_tree function,
    # incorporating splitting nodes and leaf networks, and a more complex
    # training loop to handle the hierarchical training process. This is a
    # more advanced concept beyond this basic example.
