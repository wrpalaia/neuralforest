# Neural Forest

A Neural Forest implementation using TensorFlow and Keras. This library allows you to build and train an ensemble of Neural Decision Trees.

## Features

* Differentiable decision nodes for end-to-end training.
* Customizable neural networks at each leaf node.
* Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) for training individual trees in the forest.
* Supports classification (binary/multi-class) and regression tasks.
* Easy saving and loading of trained forest models.
